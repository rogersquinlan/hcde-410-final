## Twitter Talk vs Real World Data

### Introduction
#### 

### Background and Related work
#### There are many discussions and studies on social media velocity and how this effects things like research, relationships, and conversations. Here is a cited paper.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/JanKietzmann/publication/232066851_Unpacking_the_Social_Media_Phenomenon/links/0912f507522cd0d6b6000000/Unpacking-the-Social-Media-Phenomenon.pdf. However, there is nothing directly tied to homelessness, or from what I can find. I have also come accross reseach showing the relation between social media posts and cited research. https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/Fulltext/2020/09000/Correlation_Between_Social_Media_Posts_and.5.aspx. They were able to find a weak correlation between the number of academic citations per article and the number of tweets. My research question is formualted somewhere between these two studies done. 


### Research Question
### Does the amount of social media communication (tweet counts) on homelessness reflect the true statistics of homelessness (data.world) ? 

### Methodology
#### I used a correlation test in Tabeleau to complete my analysis. The amount of Seattle homeless people per year against the number of tweets per day on average per year, from 2016-2020. Here is a link to the Seattle homelessness dataset. https://data.world/sasha/count-us-in-report-homelessness-data. The Twitter search is not a data set. I created my own data set using their advanced search. Thanks to my collegues, they were able to recommend me to use this (thanks, Lunden). I decided to center the dates from 2016 to 2020. I then used a random number generator to select a data from 0-31 to select a day out of each month for 60 months. Hencde generating a dataset of 60 points. These 60 points were how many tweets in that respective day contained "Seattle homeless" or "Seattle homelessness".  Here is a link to the advanced search. https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en

#### As far as the licensing, all I can find is "Other" on my data.world dataset. This dataset will assist me with the total counts and I may be able to go even deeper into why homelessness is increasing (if it is). I do not see any ethical concerns at this moment.

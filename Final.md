## Twitter Talk vs Real World Data
### Quinlan Rogers

### Introduction
#### Ever since COVID-19, I felt as though my social media was swarmed with posts about homelessness in Seattle. I wanted to see if this had something to do with the a rise in homelessness or if it could just be people piggy backing off eachother. How accurately does social media reflect what is going on in the real world?  

### Background and Related work
#### There are many discussions and studies on social media velocity and how this effects things like research, relationships, and conversations. Here is a cited paper. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/JanKietzmann/publication/232066851_Unpacking_the_Social_Media_Phenomenon/links/0912f507522cd0d6b6000000/Unpacking-the-Social-Media-Phenomenon.pdf. However, there is nothing directly tied to homelessness, or from what I can find. I have also come accross reseach showing the relation between social media posts and cited research. https://journals.lww.com/jaaosglobal/Fulltext/2020/09000/Correlation_Between_Social_Media_Posts_and.5.aspx. They were able to find a weak correlation between the number of academic citations per article and the number of tweets. My research question is formualted from somewhere between these two studies. 


### Research Question
### Does the amount of social media communication (tweet counts) on homelessness reflect the true statistics of homelessness (data.world) ? 

### Methodology
#### I used data visualizations in Tabeleau to complete my analysis. Combining the data for comparisons was difficult and would require standardizing the two datasets. I was unable to do this, however was able to build data visualizations to observe trends and differences between tweets and the Seattle homeless population. I looked at the amount of Seattle homeless people per year against the number of tweets per day on average per year, from 2016-2020. Here is a link to the Seattle homelessness dataset: https://data.world/sasha/count-us-in-report-homelessness-data. The Twitter search is not a data set. I created my own data set using their advanced search feature. Thanks to my collegues, they were able to recommend me to use this (thanks, Lunden). I decided to center the dates from 2016 to 2020 to explore the data before and after the start of the pandemic. I then used a random number generator to select a number from 0-31 to select a day out of each month for 60 months. Hence generating a dataset of 60 points. These 60 points were used to identify how many tweets on that respective day contained "Seattle homeless" or "Seattle homelessness".  Here is a link to the advanced search. https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en

### Findings
#### The Seattle homeless population rose from 2016-2018, then declined in 2019, then rose again in 2020. Overall, I found the population growth from 2016-2020 was 1,062 people. For the tweet counts, I found the average number of Seattle homeless/homelessness tweets per day fluctuated throughout 2016-2020. However, there was a steady rise from 2016-2019, with a peak in 2019 of 69.08 tweets per day. The low point was in 2017, with 34.02 tweets per day. There was no clear pattern or relationship between the two datasets. 


### Discussion
#### The findings showed an overall rise in the homeless population, which makes sense as a result of external socioeconomic factors. The rising trend was steady so I do not think there is much to note there. However, the amount of tweets per day fluctuated much more amongst the years, especially in 2016-2017. This interval had the sharpest increase in the homeless population but the lowest amount of tweets per day. The exact opposite of what I was expecting. Also, in 2019, the homeless population was on the decline, despite having the highest number of tweets per day. I did not find any strong correlation or trend between the two data sets, suggesting the social media does not reflect the real world data. There are some limitations while noting this outcome. I did not use overall Twitter data. How many tweets per year, the increase or decrease in users, or the engagement(retweets, likes, comments) of tweets. These would all have an effect on my Twitter dataset.

### Conclusion
#### In conclusion, there was no visual correlation between number of tweets on Seattle homelessness and the real figures. This is what I expected, as I feel that social media is far from reality and could swing accurately and innacurately depending on many factors. If I were to go deeper into this topic, I would look at Twitters API and get more data about the Seattle Homelessness tweets. I would also want to look into the pandemic to see how this affected my data from 2019 to 2020, down to the month.

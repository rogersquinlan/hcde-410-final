## A4: Preliminary Proposal

### I am planning on doing this analysis because I am interested in seeing how social media and news discussion reflects reality. I feel that recently the talk around homelessness in Seattle has increased but I want to confirm if this is linear or not, both rising. This is important because we will be able to see if news sources are pushing certain agendas or not and whether this is an increasing problem or just more visible. I hope to learn about social media data and to see if my presumptions are true. 

### The data I plan to use will come from Data.world and Seattle.gov. I will use Twitters advanced search to filter tweets about Seattle homelessness. I will be able to get specific counts from specific data ranges to compare against the homelessness data. 

### The data.world data set includes many variables such as total count, demographic, employment, duration of homelessness, cause, etc. Here is the link. You must sign up for a free account. https://data.world/sasha/count-us-in-report-homelessness-data

### The Twitter search is not a data set. I will be creating my own data set using their advanced search. thanks to my collegues, they were able to recommend me to use this (thanks, Lunden). Here is a link to their advanced search. https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en

### As far as the licensing, all I can find is "Other" on my data.world dataset. This dataset will assist me with the total counts and I may be able to go even deeper into why homelessness is increasing (if it is). I do not see any ethical concerns at this moment.

### I do not see anything stopping me from completing this. I am just about as busy as I have ever been, however I think I can handle comleting this in a timely manner. Capstone and my job will come into play, but I do not think it will hinder my ability to get a solid project finished.
